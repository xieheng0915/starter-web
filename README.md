Quoteï¼š Benefit from our many years of experience in the development of optical systems for laser material processing.

Our broad selection of beam expansion systems and LINOS F-Theta lenses meets even the most stringent demands. This comprehensive range covers everything from fixed beam expanders to modular, variable and motorized beam expanders. We also manu-facture laser beam homogenizers in cooperation with one of the market leaders in this field. The high numerical aperture of LINOS laser lenses has gained them wide popularity.
